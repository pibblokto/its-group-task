# ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements ‚ö†Ô∏è
* Before starting, you should install :

  - *[AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)*
  - *[Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)*
  - *[Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/install/)*

# ‚öôÔ∏è Additional configuration ‚öôÔ∏è
* Before starting, you should perform the following actions :
 
  * create IAM user with `AdministratorAccess`;
  * edit `~/.aws/credentials` file like shown below :<br>
    *[default]<br>
    aws_access_key_id = ACCESS_KEY_FROM_THE_FIRST_STEP<br>
    aws_secret_access_key = SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_FROM_THE_FIRST_STEP<br>*
  * change S3 Bucket config in the root `terragrunt.hcl`;
  * replace all values in `production/infrastructure/common_vars.hcl` with yours :
    * `aws_region` - in which AWS Region to provision infrastructure;
    * `profile` - IAM User profile name (from the second step) used to perform all actions in AWS;
    * `project` & `environment` - your project and environment names, respectively;
    * `accound_id` - AWS Account used for infrastructure provisioning;
    * `certificate_arn` - ACM SSL Certificate ARN used for Application Load Balancer and CloudFront Distribution HTTPS requests.

# üõÑ S3 Bucket üõÑ 
* Amazon S3 is used to keep `static files` for the Django application. Also, CloudFront Distribution caches the S3 bucket's content to provide the `lowest latency` (time delay) so that content is delivered with `the best possible performance`. 

# „äôÔ∏è Parameter Store „äôÔ∏è
* Systems Manager Parameter Store is used to keep all secrets that you want to `securely` use across your environment(s). As shown in the project scheme, this service `isn't managed` by Terragrunt. It's necessary not to transmit secrets in plain text inside .tf files. This means that you need to create parameters manually. Let's do it together!

* Open `Systems Manager` -> `Parameter Store` in the `same region` you specified in `production/infrastructure/common_vars.hcl` :
  * click on `Create parameter`;
  * `Name`. You `must` name parameters according to the template : `PROJECT_NAME-ENVIRONMENT_PARAMETER_NAME`. `PROJECT_NAME` & `ENVIRONMENT` are the same values as you specified in `production/infrastructure/common_vars.hcl` for `project` & `environment` in accordance. For `PARAMETER_NAME`, enter the needed value yourself;
  * for `Description` input what you wish. `Tier` - `Standart`, `Type` - `SecureString`, `Value` - fill in yourself üòâ
  
* In our case, we used `project = team-task` & `environment = production` in `production/infrastructure/common_vars.hcl`, so the list with parameters in Parameter Store will look like this :<br>
