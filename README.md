# ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements ‚ö†Ô∏è
* Before starting, you should install :

  - *[AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)*
  - *[Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)*
  - *[Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/install/)*

# ‚öôÔ∏è Additional configuration ‚öôÔ∏è
* Before starting, you should perform the following actions :
 
  * create IAM user with `AdministratorAccess`;
  * edit `~/.aws/credentials` file like shown below :<br>
    *[default]<br>
    aws_access_key_id = ACCESS_KEY_FROM_THE_FIRST_STEP<br>
    aws_secret_access_key = SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_FROM_THE_FIRST_STEP<br>*
  * change S3 Bucket config in the root `terragrunt.hcl`;
  * replace all values in `production/infrastructure/common_vars.hcl` with yours :
    * `aws_region` - in which AWS Region to provision infrastructure;
    * `profile` - IAM User profile name (from the second step) used to perform all actions in AWS;
    * `project` & `environment` - your project and environment names, respectively;
    * `accound_id` - AWS Account used for infrastructure provisioning;
    * `certificate_arn` - ACM SSL Certificate ARN used for Application Load Balancer and CloudFront Distribution HTTPS requests.

# üõÑ S3 Bucket üõÑ 
* Amazon S3 stores `static files` for the Django application. Also, CloudFront Distribution caches the S3 bucket's content to provide the `lowest latency` (time delay) so that content is delivered with `the best possible performance`.

# „äôÔ∏è Parameter Store „äôÔ∏è
* Systems Manager Parameter Store keeps all secrets you want to `securely` use across your environment(s). As shown in the project scheme, this service `isn't managed` by Terragrunt. It's necessary not to transmit secrets in plain text inside .tf files. This means that you need to create parameters manually. Let's do it together!

* Open `Systems Manager` -> `Parameter Store` in the `same region` you specified in `production/infrastructure/common_vars.hcl` :
  * click on `Create parameter`;
  * `Name`. You `must` name parameters according to the template : `PROJECT_NAME-ENVIRONMENT_PARAMETER_NAME`. `PROJECT_NAME` & `ENVIRONMENT` are the same values as you specified in `production/infrastructure/common_vars.hcl` for `project` & `environment` in accordance. For `PARAMETER_NAME`, enter the needed value yourself;
  * for `Description` input what you wish. `Tier` - `Standart`, `Type` - `SecureString`, `Value` - fill in yourself üòâ
  
* In our case, we used `project = team-task` & `environment = production` in `production/infrastructure/common_vars.hcl`, so the list with parameters in Parameter Store will look like this :

# üíæ RDS üíæ
* Django application closely interacts with the Postgres database placed in a separate RDS instance. This instance `isn't publicly accessible` and is located in a `private` VPC subnet. Another thing is that RDS Service allows us to enable automated backups for the database. If needed, you can do it manually in the AWS Management Console (manual snapshot won't disappear in case of database deletion). 

* As you might have guessed, we need to pass some secrets into our configuration (`the name of the database` to create when the DB instance is created, this database is used for migration in Django; `master username` and `password`). Of course, Parameter Store will help us to solve this problem.

* In `Parameter Store` block on the image, you can see the following parameters :
  * `team-task-production_postgres_db` contains the database name for migration in Django;
  * `team-task-production_database_username` contains the `master username` name;
  * `team-task-production_database_password` contains the `master user` password.
  
* As you remember, we used the template for parameters naming : `PROJECT_NAME-ENVIRONMENT_PARAMETER_NAME`. `PROJECT_NAME` & `ENVIRONMENT` are automatically inputted from `production/infrastructure/common_vars.hcl` `project` & `environment` variables in accordance. Therefore, `PARAMETER_NAME's are : 
  * `postgres_db`;
  * `database_username`;
  * `database_password`.
  
* Now we need to enter parameters names from the previous step as `VALUES` for `postgres_db`, `database_username`, and `database_password` `VARIABLES` into the `production/infrastructure/db_instance/terragrunt.hcl`, lines 48-50 :
```
postgres_db                     = "postgres_db"
database_username               = "database_username"
database_password               = "database_password"
```
